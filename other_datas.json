The second keeps track of each student's\nname, country of birth, current address. In order to maintain strong ties to its alumni, the\nschool holds various events around the world. Events have title, date, location and time.\nThe school needs to keep track of which graduates have attended which events. For an\nattendance by a graduate at an event, a comment is recorded about information. School\nofficials learn from that graduate at that event. As with the events, school records\ninformation learned from graduates. When an official knows that he or she will be\nmeeting or talking to graduate, a report is produced showing the latest information about\nthe graduate and the information learned during the past two years from that graduate\nfrom all contacts and events the graduate attended.\n\n5.

Every tables-tops is equipped with large tablet\nscreen and using the table each customers selects the food items they would like to order.\nOnce the customers selects the items, the restaurant system automatically dispatches the\nfood items selected as the order to the kitchen unit of the restaurant. Again, when the food\nitem is prepared, the robot named \"Ginger\" will get called in by kitchen unit for\ndelivering the food item to the particular table number through system. The food plate,\nonce being loaded onto the tray of Ginger, which delivers the food up to the customer\ntable and then system get updated as the order, is delivered and due bill is generated for\nthe food item of that table. This process might be repeated for multiple times as the\nadditional food ordering and serving might happen frequently. Finally, the customer pays\naccumulated bill either swiping the credit/debit card or through online payment. Order\ntaking process, order dispatching process, food delivery and paper bill carrying up to the\ntable through humans are eliminated so, they claimed it as complete digital restaurant.\nNow answer the followings:\n\ni) Prepare the USE case diagram of the system.\nii) Prepare activity diagram of the system.\n\niii) Prepare the sequence diagram of the system.\n.
